Use of AI Tools in This Project

AI tools were used only as coding assistants, never as code generators replacing understanding or decision-making.
All code, methodology, modeling choices, architecture, debugging logic, and experimental design were fully understood, controlled, and validated by myself.

AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) were used for:

1. Debugging Assistance
	•	Understanding error messages
	•	Fixing import-path issues
	•	Identifying missing dependencies
	•	Suggestions for refactoring when something broke

2. Documentation Support
	•	Improving clarity of README.md
	•	Rewording some explanations for readability
	•	Structuring parts of the report more clearly

3. Clarifying Python Concepts
	•	Revising pandas/NumPy functions
	•	Confirming how caching logic and file system operations behave
	•	Quick reminders of Python syntax or library usage

4. Code Review / Style Suggestions
	•	Suggestions for cleaner function names
	•	Advice on how to reorganize the project folder
	•	Comments on maintainability and reproducibility

All suggestions were rewritten or adapted manually.
No code was pasted blindly.
