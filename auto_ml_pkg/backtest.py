    Backtest a top-k long strategy based on predicted EXCESS returns.

    - Rebalances the portfolio every `rebalance_every` dates.
    - At each rebalance date, invests equally in the top_k tickers
      with the highest predicted excess return.
    - Uses realized excess returns in `future_excess` at those dates.
    - Subtracts transaction costs proportional to turnover.
